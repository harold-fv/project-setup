## Description
The personalized nuutrition recommendation engine is powered by 4 primary components.
A User health info input forms and a fitness goal selector that feeds the calculators for Bsaal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and BMI calculators
B Two API functions to call for and receive respones from two APIS (Nutritionix and Edamam)
C Searchbox and foodlog that allows the user to send their search query to the APIs to receive nutritional data in response
D A modal to display recommendations based on values outputted my BMR and BMI calculators
## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
