## Description


The personalized nuutrition recommendation engine is powered by 4 primary components.

A User health info input forms and a fitness goal selector that feeds the calculators for Bsaal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and BMI calculators
B Two API functions to call for and receive respones from two APIS (Nutritionix and Edamam)
C Searchbox and foodlog that allows the user to send their search query to the APIs to receive nutritional data in response
D A modal to display recommendations based on values outputted my BMR and BMI calculators

## User Story


AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning


WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes


WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order


WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
